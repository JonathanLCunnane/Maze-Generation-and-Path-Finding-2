require_relative 'cell'

# We need to be able to generate an empty grid in generate_grid.
# And also configure the cells by setting the cells in each of
# their cardinal directions in configure_grid.
# We also NEED to define a custom array accessor in [] so that
# if cells out of the bounds of the grid try to be accessed,
# null is returned.

# Random cell selection is in random_cell.
# The number of cells is in count.
